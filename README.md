# 🗺️ Map Navigator using Dijkstra's Algorithm (Java)

This is a simple map navigation system that finds the **shortest path** between two locations using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, written in Java. The path calculation can be based on distance and can be extended to consider traffic or weights.

## 🚀 Features

- Represent a map as a graph (nodes = locations, edges = roads)
- Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path
- Optionally account for traffic weights or delays
